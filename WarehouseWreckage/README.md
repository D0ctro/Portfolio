# Warehouse Wreckage

I made a game in Unreal 5.1 to learn about physics and get used to Unreal Engine. 

The assets utilized in this small beginner project were not created by me but were provided within the online course I purchased on Udemy.
The course I followed is provided by GameDev.TV.

Warehouse Wreckage is a small game where I got used to important basics of UE5. 
The player can fly around the level, and by pressing spacebar, shoot out metall balls where is is looking at. 
Those can knock over Barrels and Racks in the level to simulate real physics.

# How To Play

The Goal of the game is to knock down as many barrels as possible. 
The catch is, that you have a limited amount of ammo and need to use it wisely.
Otherwise if you are on 0 ammo you cant shoot anymore and the level will automatically restart. 

# Controls

The Controls are the following:

- Move around the Level = "WASD"
- Move up and down = "Q" & "E"
- Shoot metall ball = "Spacebar"

# Improvements

For enhancing this game or continuing its development, consider the following additions and improvements:

- Tracking the amount of barrels hit or barrels that moved off of their start position making them count as hit.
- Showing the tracked hit barrels on screen
- Adding a highscore functionality
- An actual player + Model that can run around a level instead of flying around
- More Assets and actual level design
- Time limit?
- Perhaps an explosive barrel that can explode on hit making other barrels fall over as well
