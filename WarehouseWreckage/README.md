# 2D Snowboard Game

I made a 2D Side scroller Snowboarding game with the goal to drive down the mountain and reach the finish line. 

The assets utilized in this small beginner project were not created by me but were provided within the online course I purchased on Udemy. The game itself was a step-by-step tutorial that I followed to a certain extent before incorporating my own mechanics and ideas to enhance my comprehension of the concepts learned.

In my first side scroller is a snowboarding game where you try to reach the finish line while not falling on your head and thus resetting the level. 
In this game you can rotate your character mid air and gain speed when landing a "trick".

# How To Play

In order to play my Snowboarding game you will need to drive down the mountain safely and reach the goal. 
Doing tricks will speed up this process by holding down W to get a speed boost and zoom down the mountain or do big jumps using the mountain slopes. 
Or hold down S to slow down and ensure you wont crash or will not jump too far after a slope. 
If you land on your head you will respawn in the beginning of the track so try not to.
