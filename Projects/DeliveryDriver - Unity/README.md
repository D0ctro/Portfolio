# Delivery Driver

Delivery Driver is a small 2D Top Down car driving game made in Unity.

The assets utilized in this small beginner project were not created by me but were provided within the online course I purchased on Udemy. The game itself was a step-by-step tutorial that I followed to a certain extent before incorporating my own mechanics and ideas to enhance my comprehension of the concepts learned.

## Description

In Delivery Driver, you will need to maneuver through a small town driving a delivery car. You will find packages that need to be delivered, so you pick them up by driving over them and deliver them to the waiting recipients of said packages.
On your way, you will find green boost pads that will increase your speed until you crash, so make sure not to crash to keep your speed!

## How To Play

The goal of Delivery Driver is to collect all the packages spread out in the town and bring them back to any recipient. As the game is straightforward, the objects used for the interactable are just differentiated by using different sizes, geometrical forms, and colors. 
- Package = purple square
- Boost Pad = Green Circle
- Recipient = Blue Triangle
- '...' = Orange big circle

## Controls 

The Controls are the following:

- W & S = positive and negative acceleration
- A & D = Steering right/left

## Improvements

The game was only a start to get to know Unity and get comfortable with using scripts and objects. For further improvement, I could:

- Add a timer that stops once every package has been delivered.
- Put the tracked time in a leaderboard and make yourself able to beat your own times.
- Give the player Lives that they lose under certain conditions, making them restart the level.
- Add more obstacles that might slow you down or make you lose said lives.

These improvements could help make somebody enjoy this little game for longer and would help better my programming skills.
