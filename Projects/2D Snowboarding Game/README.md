# Delivery Driver

Delivery Driver is a small 2D Top Down car driving game made in Unity.

The assets utilized in this small beginner project were not created by me but were provided within the online course I purchased on Udemy. The game itself was a step-by-step tutorial that I followed to a certain extent before incorporating my own mechanics and ideas to enhance my comprehension of the concepts learned.
