# 2D Snowboard Game

I made a 2D Side scroller Snowboarding game with the goal to drive down the mountain and reach the finish line. 

The assets utilized in this small beginner project were not created by me but were provided within the online course I purchased on Udemy. The game itself was a step-by-step tutorial that I followed to a certain extent before incorporating my own mechanics and ideas to enhance my comprehension of the concepts learned.
